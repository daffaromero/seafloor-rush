Approximately 9 million tons of plastic waste find their way into the ocean annually, posing a severe threat to marine ecosystems and highlighting the urgent need for effective waste management solutions.
The majority of ocean plastic waste sinks to the deep seafloor, where its concentration is a thousand times greater than on the water's surface, posing a significant environmental concern.
Over the course of several decades, plastic undergoes decomposition in saltwater, releasing a blend of chemicals present in its composition, posing environmental and ecological risks.
Every year, more than a million seabirds and hundreds of thousands of other marine animals are killed by plastic because they mistake plastic waste for food and starve to death with a stomach full of plastic.
Octopuses have three hearts and the organ heart actually stops beating when the octopus swims, explaining the species' penchant for crawling rather than swimming, which exhausts them.
Octopus ink serves not only as a concealment but also inflicts physical harm on predators; failure to escape their own ink may result in the death of the octopuses themselves.
