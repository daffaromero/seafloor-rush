Around 9 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the ocean every year.
Most plastic waste at the ocean sink to the depths of the seafloor and their concentration on the seabed is a thousand times higher than on the water's surface.
Plastic decomposes in saltwater over decades, releasing the cocktail of chemicals that it is made of.
Every year, more than a million seabirds and hundreds of thousands of other marine animals are killed by plastic because they mistake plastic waste for food and starve to death with a stomach full of plastic.Octopuses have three hearts and the organ heart actually stops beating when the octopus swims, explaining the species’ penchant for crawling rather than swimming, which exhausts them.
Octopus ink doesn’t just hide them but also physically harms enemies and can kill themselves if they do not escape from their own ink.
